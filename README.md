Modelling an E-Commerce System Using Unordered Maps, Stacks, and Queues in C++

This research presents a data-driven virtual application that simulates an efficient e-commerce system.
The system leverages three core data structures—queue, stack, and unordered map—each selected to align with the system’s logical flow and performance demands.
The chosen implementation strategy is thoroughly justified, alternative data structure options are explored, and relevant design trade-offs are evaluated. A UML diagram is also provided for structural clarity.
The C++ implementation demonstrates a practical approach to aligning data structure usage with real-world e-commerce operations.
